# Automatidata Project – Advanced Data Analytics

## Project Overview
The **Automatidata Project** is an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project completed as part of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
It simulates a real-world business scenario where data analysts work with stakeholders to analyze data, perform statistical inference, and build predictive models.

The project uses a **New York City Taxi Trip dataset** to derive insights and develop regression and classification models.

---

## Project Objectives
- **Fare Prediction (Regression)**
  - Predict taxi fare amounts based on trip features
  - Identify key factors influencing fare pricing

- **Tip Prediction (Classification)**
  - Classify trips into high-tip vs low-tip categories
  - Understand passenger tipping behavior

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset is a pedagogical version of the NYC Taxi dataset and includes:
- Trip distance
- Trip duration
- Passenger count
- Pickup and drop-off locations
- Fare amount
- Tip amount
- Payment type

The data reflects real-world challenges such as skewed distributions, outliers, and correlated features.

- **Libraries:**
  - pandas, numpy
  - matplotlib, seaborn
  - scipy, statsmodels
  - scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing  
4. Feature engineering  
5. Regression and classification modeling  
6. Model evaluation and interpretation
